### About the Application

### User Sign Up
Once you have arrived to the website, you will be prompted to create an account. This will require you to input a valid email address and create a password. On your first sign in you will also be asked to upload a picture of your pet and fill out a short bio.

### User Sign In

### How to Report Bugs or Issues
Bugs and Issues can be reported through our GitHub repository located at https://github.com/arn1313/kritter-frontend/issues. To create a new issue, simply click the green "New Issue" button, and add a description of the issue or bug, with a method for replication if possible.

### Credit and Thanks
We obviously borrowed heavily from current Social Media's like Facebook and Twitter for our styling and the thought process behind our choices of functionality.
We modeled our backend off of the sluggram-backend created by Duncan Marsh https://github.com/slugbyte and greatly appreciate all of the hard work he put into the build.

### Upcoming features
**Friends** We would love to add a friends feature in future updates. This way your pets could create circles. Also by adding this functionality, we could begin to incorporate an events calendar, so your pets can schedule play dates with their friends.

### FAQs
**Why Kritter?** People love their pets and there are plenty of animals represented on Social Media. We thought it was time pets had their own platform to shine and share their stories.

**How long did it take to build?** We built Kritter in four days with four developers.
