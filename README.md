### About the Application
 We built Kritter as a Social Media platform for your pets. Finally the unrepresented members of your family have their own platform to express themselves to the world with a little bit of help from you and your thumbs.


### How to Use
To use the app just navigate to our website located at """""""" and create an account. After you become a member you will have full access to all the features of Kritter.

### User Sign Up
Once you have arrived to the website, you will be prompted to create an account. This will require you to input a valid email address and create a password. On your first sign in you will also be asked to upload a picture of your pet and fill out a short bio.

### User Sign In
Once you have set up your account, the next time you visit the site you will be prompted to enter your email and password and you will be ready to start connecting and sharing with all animal friends.

### Credit and Thanks
We obviously borrowed heavily from current Social Media's like Facebook and Twitter for our styling and the thought process behind our choices of functionality.
We modeled our backend off of the sluggram-backend created by Duncan Marsh https://github.com/slugbyte and greatly appreciate all of the hard work he put into the build.

### Upcoming features

### FAQs
**Why Kritter?** People love their pets and there are plenty of animals represented on Social Media. We thought it was time pets had their own platform to shine and share their stories.

**How long did it take to build?** We built Kritter in four days with four developers.

![Isaiah](./img/a.png)

Isaiah is a creature from earth. He identifies as human/other. He enjoys eating food, sleeping from time to time(on a daily basis...sometimes), and living life. Isaiah emerged into this realm roughly 27years ago with the intent to do things. Isaiah has recently taken part in the life-time companionship agreement with another creature from earth(Katie). Be aware that when approaching Isaiah, he may seem distracted or spaced out. This is normal, he is just trying to figure out what he will be eating later that day.

![Aaron](./img/a.jpg)

Aaron moved to Seattle from San Francisco in 1999.  He worked in retail and bank management for many years but transitioned into a role as an Office Manager and Paralegal in 2012. During that time he assisted on several high profile lawsuits including the Oso Land Slide case in Snohomish County. Earlier this year he decided that he needed a change and a career more inline with the direction Seattle has been moving. This led him to Code Fellows and a future in tech.
